# Awesome-Attacks-On-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-Systems
___

The following repository contains a comprehensive list of research papers that cover different types of attacks on Retrieval Augmented Generation systems split into 6 broad categories. We also try to include defenses against such type of attacks in hopes of shedding light on some work done towards making Robust RAGs. The attacks cover both red-teaming and adversarial attacks.
